Extract ONLY the data explicitly requested in the user's prompt above.\n        2. Do NOT extract data that wasn't specifically mentioned in the user's prompt.\n        3. STRICT ENFORCEMENT: If the user requests specific fields like \"sender\" or \"invoice_number\", \n           extract ONLY those fields and nothing else. DO NOT extract additional fields like \"route\" \n           or \"delivery date\" unless they were explicitly requested.\n           \n           IMPORTANT: A request to extract \"name of sender\" should ONLY result in a \"sender\" field.\n           IMPORTANT: A request to extract \"invoice details\" should NOT extract unrelated fields like \"salesperson\".\n           \n        4.
