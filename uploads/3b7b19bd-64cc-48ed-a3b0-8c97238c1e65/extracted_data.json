Extract ONLY the data explicitly requested in the user's prompt above.\n        2. Do NOT extract data that wasn't specifically mentioned in the user's prompt.\n        3. STRICT ENFORCEMENT: If the user requests specific fields like \"sender\" or \"invoice_number\", \n           extract ONLY those fields and nothing else. DO NOT extract additional fields like \"route\" \n           or \"delivery date\" unless they were explicitly requested.\n           \n           IMPORTANT: A request to extract \"name of sender\" should ONLY result in a \"sender\" field.\n           IMPORTANT: A request to extract \"invoice details\" should NOT extract unrelated fields like \"salesperson\".\n           \n        4. For each extracted field, include:\n          - The field value\n          - A confidence score between 0 and 1\n          \n        \n        5. If a requested field is not found in the document, include it with a null value and low confidence score.\n        \n        6. For line items or tabular data (if specifically requested in the prompt):\n          - Extract these as structured arrays of objects\n          - Ensure each line item is a complete object with all its properties\n          - DO NOT use objects with [object Object] notation\n          - Use proper array syntax with each item as a discrete object with key-value pairs\n          - ALWAYS structure tabular data as an array where each row is an object with named fields\n          - Example for table data:\n            \"table\": [\n              { \"column1\": { \"value\": \"row1value1\", \"confidence\": 0.9 }, \"column2\": { \"value\": \"row1value2\", \"confidence\": 0.95 } },\n              { \"column1\": { \"value\": \"row2value1\", \"confidence\": 0.9 }, \"column2\": { \"value\": \"row2value2\", \"confidence\": 0.95 } }\n            ]\n          - Maintain proper parent-child relationships\n\n        Example format:\n        {\n          \"field_name\": {\n            \"value\": \"extracted value\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.95\n          }\n        }\n\n        Return ONLY the data in valid JSON format without any markdown code block markers or explanations.\n      ","processingTimeMs":2186,"options":{"includeConfidence":true,"includePositions":false,"detectDocumentType":true,"temperature":0.1}}}
