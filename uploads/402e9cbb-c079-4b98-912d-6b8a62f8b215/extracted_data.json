You MUST return ONLY valid JSON with no text explanations.\n2. First identify the document type (e.g., receipt, invoice, business card, manifest, purchase order, email, contract) and include it in a 'document_type' field.\n3. For multi-entry fields such as \"line items\", \"products\", \"transactions\", etc., ALWAYS structure them as ARRAYS of OBJECTS, where each object represents one entry with its own subfields. Example:\n   \"line_items\": [\n     {\n       \"description\": {\"value\": \"Item 1\", \"confidence\": 0.95},\n       \"quantity\": {\"value\": 2, \"confidence\": 0.95},\n       \"price\": {\"value\": 10.00, \"confidence\": 0.95}\n     },\n     {\n       \"description\": {\"value\": \"Item 2\", \"confidence\": 0.9},\n       \"quantity\": {\"value\": 1, \"confidence\": 0.9},\n       \"price\": {\"value\": 15.00, \"confidence\": 0.9}\n     }\n   ]\n4. For regular fields, use the format:\n   \"field_name\": {\n     \"value\": \"extracted value\",\n     \"confidence\": 0.95\n   }\n5. Identify the document structure (tables, lists) and extract repeating patterns accordingly.\n6. If the field contains multiple distinct entries (e.g., line items in an invoice), always return them as separate objects in an array, not as a single concatenated string.\n\nPlease extract the following fields from the document and return them as JSON:\nline items and name","processingTimeMs":5306,"options":{"includeConfidence":true,"includePositions":false,"detectDocumentType":true,"temperature":0.1}}}
