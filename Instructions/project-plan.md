## Document Review Page Enhancement Tasks


## Two-Panel Layout Transformation Tasks

### Panel Structure & Proportions
- [ ] Implement golden ratio split (61.8%/38.2%) for optimal visual balance between document preview and data panel
- [ ] Create seamless draggable divider with subtle handle indicator (6px width, 60px height)
- [ ] Design responsive anchoring system that maintains golden ratio on window resize
- [ ] Add smooth animation (300ms ease-out) when toggling between balanced and document-focused views
- [ ] Implement layout memory that persists user's preferred panel proportions between sessions

### Visual Framing & Elevation
- [ ] Apply subtle container shadows to each panel (0px 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08))
- [ ] Create 16px outer margin around entire workspace to prevent edge crowding
- [ ] Implement 2px subtle border radius on panel corners for softer appearance
- [ ] Design 1px inner border for panels with 8% opacity for definition without harshness
- [ ] Add micro drop shadow to divider on drag for depth feedback (0px 0px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15))

### Document Panel Enhancement
- [ ] Increase document preview size by 20% to improve readability and detail visibility
- [ ] Create subtle 24px document padding with soft background (f8f9fa) for comfortable reading
- [ ] Implement high-quality rendering with antialiasing for crisp document text
- [ ] Design elegant zoom controls (floating bottom-right, semi-transparent until hover)
- [ ] Add subtle page-turn animation for multi-page navigation (200ms ease-in-out)

### Data Form Panel Refinement
- [ ] Redesign data panel with 24px side padding and 16px between field groups
- [ ] Create visual field grouping with subtle background shifts (2% opacity change)
- [ ] Implement elegant typography with increased line height (1.6) for better readability
- [ ] Design smooth input field animations on focus (subtle 2px inward shift)
- [ ] Add micro-interactions for successful field completion (subtle flash of success color)

### Color & Contrast Strategy
- [ ] Implement calming neutral palette for panels (#f9fafb background with #1e293b text)
- [ ] Create subtle contrast between panels (2-3% brightness difference) for visual separation
- [ ] Design balanced accent color system (primary: #3b82f6, 60% opacity for secondary elements)
- [ ] Apply subtle color shifts on panel focus to direct attention (5% brightness increase)
- [ ] Implement contextual color highlighting that responds to user actions and current focus

### Panel Transitions & Animation
- [ ] Create smooth reflow animations when panels resize (250ms ease-out)
- [ ] Design subtle background color transitions when switching between panels (200ms)
- [ ] Implement elegant loading states with skeleton screens instead of spinners
- [ ] Add micro-animations for panel expansion/collapse (scale and fade combined)
- [ ] Design seamless panel switching with 300ms crossfade transitions

### Navigation & Focus Management
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for panel focus toggling (Alt+1, Alt+2)
- [ ] Create subtle focus indicators that don't distract from content (2px accent border)
- [ ] Design intelligent focus management that anticipates user's next action
- [ ] Add gesture support for panel resizing on touch devices (pinch/spread)
- [ ] Implement history state management for back/forward navigation between panel states

### Content Density Optimization
- [ ] Design smart content scaling that adjusts information density based on panel size
- [ ] Create progressive disclosure patterns that reveal details on demand
- [ ] Implement collapsible sections with elegant animation (200ms ease)
- [ ] Add intelligent whitespace distribution that maintains visual hierarchy
- [ ] Design responsive typography that scales subtly with panel width (fluid typography)

### Visual Harmony & Balance
- [ ] Implement consistent 8px grid system across both panels
- [ ] Create visual rhythm with repeated spacing patterns (8px, 16px, 24px, 40px)
- [ ] Design balanced asymmetry that guides the eye naturally between panels
- [ ] Add subtle visual connections between related elements across panels
- [ ] Implement consistent corner radius strategy across all UI elements (4px for inputs, 8px for panels)

### User Flow Enhancement

- [ ] Design intelligent cursor adaptation based on current context and panel
- [ ] Implement subtle visual cues that guide users through optimal workflow
- [ ] Add contextual panel expansion for detailed work (e.g., expand document panel when annotating)
- [ ] Design elegant state transitions when moving between workflow steps
