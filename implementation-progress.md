# Dynamic Data Display Implementation Progress

## Completed Steps

### 1. Update Document API Endpoint ✅

**File:** `/app/api/documents/[id]/route.ts`

The following changes have been implemented:

- ✅ Modified the API to use the exact extraction prompt from the user
- ✅ Removed hardcoded data structure assumptions (invoice-specific fields)
- ✅ Implemented a more flexible JSON schema for extracted data
- ✅ Added metadata about the extraction process to the response
- ✅ Improved error handling for malformed extraction results

**Key Changes:**
1. Replaced the hardcoded invoice-specific data structure with a flexible schema that can handle any document type
2. Added location data to the field structure to support highlighting in the document viewer
3. Created a metadata structure to track extraction details (timestamp, model, prompt, processing time)
4. Enhanced error handling to provide more detailed information when extraction fails
5. Updated the prompt to be more generic and adaptable to different document types
6. Added an example format in the prompt to guide the AI model without enforcing a specific structure

### 2. Enhance ResultDisplay Component ✅

**File:** `/components/ResultDisplay.tsx`

The following changes have been implemented:

- ✅ Refactored to handle any JSON structure, not just invoice data
- ✅ Created a recursive renderer for nested data structures
- ✅ Added visual indicators for confidence scores
- ✅ Implemented collapsible sections for complex data
- ✅ Added search/filter functionality for large datasets

**Key Changes:**
1. Created a recursive `DynamicDataRenderer` component that can handle any nested data structure
2. Added color-coded confidence score badges (green for high, yellow for medium, red for low)
3. Implemented collapsible sections for complex nested objects with expand/collapse all functionality
4. Added search functionality that filters data based on field names and values
5. Improved the UI with better formatting, spacing, and visual hierarchy
6. Added hover interactions that can trigger highlighting in the document viewer
7. Added a legend explaining the confidence score indicators

### 3. Create a Flexible Data Visualization Component ✅

**File:** `/components/DataVisualizer.tsx`

The following changes have been implemented:

- ✅ Built a new component specifically for visualizing extracted data
- ✅ Supported multiple visualization modes (table, tree, key-value pairs)
- ✅ Implemented hover interactions for highlighting
- ✅ Added export options for different formats
- ✅ Included confidence score visualization

**Key Changes:**
1. Created a standalone `DataVisualizer` component with three visualization modes:
   - Tree view for hierarchical data exploration
   - Table view for flat, structured viewing
   - JSON view for raw data inspection
2. Added advanced filtering capabilities with a confidence threshold slider
3. Implemented data export functionality (CSV and JSON formats)
4. Enhanced search functionality that works across all view modes
5. Added interactive elements for highlighting and selection
6. Implemented responsive layout with proper overflow handling
7. Created a flattening algorithm for converting nested data to tabular format
8. Added visual indicators for confidence scores across all view modes

### 4. Update Review Page to Use New Components ✅

**File:** `/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/review/[id]/page.tsx`

The following changes have been implemented:

- ✅ Replaced hardcoded data display with new dynamic components
- ✅ Added state management for hover interactions
- ✅ Implemented data filtering based on confidence scores
- ✅ Added UI controls for adjusting visualization preferences
- ✅ Ensured responsive layout for different screen sizes

**Key Changes:**
1. Updated the data types to match our new flexible schema
2. Replaced the hardcoded invoice-specific display with the new DataVisualizer component
3. Added hover state management to highlight fields in the PDF viewer
4. Implemented confidence threshold filtering with a slider control
5. Added metadata display with a tooltip for extraction details
6. Enhanced the export functionality to include/exclude metadata
7. Improved the layout and UI controls for better user experience
8. Removed the tab-based interface in favor of the more flexible visualization modes
9. Added field selection handling for potential editing functionality

### 5. Enhance Extraction API ✅

**File:** `/app/api/extract/route.ts`

The following changes have been implemented:

- ✅ Updated to handle any document type, not just invoices
- ✅ Improved prompt engineering for better extraction results
- ✅ Added support for document structure detection
- ✅ Implemented confidence scoring for all extracted fields
- ✅ Added position data for highlighting capabilities

**Key Changes:**
1. Added document type detection to automatically identify the type of document being processed
2. Created a flexible options interface to control extraction behavior (confidence scores, positions, etc.)
3. Improved prompt engineering with clearer instructions and examples
4. Added comprehensive metadata about the extraction process
5. Enhanced error handling with more detailed error messages
6. Implemented performance tracking to measure extraction time
7. Increased token limit for more detailed extraction results
8. Added support for custom extraction prompts from the user
9. Improved JSON parsing with better error handling for malformed responses

**Next Steps:**
- Implement step 6: Testing Strategy
- Test the enhanced extraction API with various document types
